# TL;DR for this discussion section

* Specs should be both concise and complete. This can be hard!
* Sometimes it's nice to have consistent error handling within a module
* When handling malformed input, one can use Options, Exceptions, or say it's Undefined behavior. These all have tradeoffs.
* For computational code, time complexity and space complexity (performance) are super important to note.
* Minor algorithm details (such as sorting stability) may also be important
* A big part of CS and engineering is communication
* Writing docs, signatures, and test cases is a great way to communicate with coworkers.
